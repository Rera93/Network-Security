Assume that I (the attacker) lure the victim into a website that I control, say www.attacker.com. Afterwards, I can embed a link into the domain I want to spoof, say www.blackboard.com. When the victim loads the webpage provided by the attacker, he/she will notice that an image or whatever from blackboard.com is needed. Thus, it will first request whois blackboard.com. When the attacker hands in the www.attacker.com webpage he will know what that the next step of the victim would be asking for blackboard.com. At the moment, the race with the legitimate DNS server can be started. In other words, the attacker will know when the victim will send the request to blackboard.com without even sending the sending the request so he can start the race to the DNS server. 

According to the Kaminsky's attack (2008), the attacker instead of including just one link to blackboard.com, he can include links to many subdomains to blackboard.com. When the victim loads that malicious webpage, he/she will send DNS request to everyone of them. So, the attacker can race for every single one of them. Morover, the attacker can send an ADDITIONAL SECTION which is www.blackboard.com. Since the victim sent a request to a subdomain of blackboard.com, this will pass the bailiwick check since the server will be authorized to answer for that domain.
