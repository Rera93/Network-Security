The 0x20 bit randomization will randomize the capitalization of the domain names in the QUESTION SECTION. Let's assume the domain name is x characters long. Then the 0x20 will add x bit of entropy to the 32 bit of entropy we already have from QID and source port randomization. In other words, the 0x20 bit has 2^x possibilites to be added to the 32 bit entropy. So, the total possibilites would be 2^{x+32}. Since the attacker can guess just once the odds to get it right will be 1/(2^{x+32}).
