a) When the destination address of a packet is not matched by any of the rules of the routing table, then the packet will be sent through the default route containing a destionation address of 0.0.0.0/0.

b) Route 9 indicates that all the packets with destination IP address 145.116.128.0/22 are on the same network as we are since there is no gateway and the packet is sent directly to the wlp3s0 interfaces. The absence of a gateway can be observed also from the G flag missing from the flags column. 

Routes 4 - 6 will pass through the 145.116.128.1 gateway over the wlp3s0 interface. This is the IP address of the router itself. In these routes the G flag is present. The destination IP addresses per packet are different between routes 4-6. 

Route 4 is valid for dest IP addresses 10.0.0.0/8 where the first byte is fixed while the other 3 bytes are not fixed and can very between 0-255 per byte. 

Route 5 is valid for dest IP addresses 172.16.0.0/12 where the first 12 bits are fixed while the 4 remaining bits of the 2nd byte and the last 2 bytes are not fixed. The second byte will vary between 16-31 and the last two bytes between 0-255.

Route 6 is valid for dest IP address 192.168.0.0/16 where the first 2 bytes are fixed while the last 2 bytes are not and vary between 0-255 per byte.

c) Route 3 has no gateway so the packet will directly traverse to its destination over the tap0 interface. 

d) Route 8 

e) Route 10 sends packets with destination address being the IP address of the VPN machine through the gateway 145.116.128.1 being the router IP address. If this route was not provided on the routing table than no connection to the VPN would be established.
