a) IP spoofing describes the process of altering the header information of an IP packet especially the source addrress. The Internet protocol (IP) is a network protocol operating at layer 3 (network) of the OSI model. It is a connectionless model which means that there is no information regarding transaction state. Additionally, there is no method to ensure that a packet is properly delivered to the destination. By altering the source address field of the ip packets, an attacker can disguise his original ip address and can use this technique for various attack scenarios. There are two main scenarios for IP spoofing: the attacker sits on the same subnet and the attacker sits outside the subnet of his victim. If the attacker sits outside the subnet then most of the time the attack is blind ip spoofing because there is no way to catch reponding ip packets. If the attacker sits inside the same subnet then it is called non-blind ip spoofing. If non-blind ip spoofing is applied then most of the time the machine with the spoofed ip is attacked by some sort of DoS attack, so the attacker can fetch the responding ip packets which were originally meant for the spoofed machine.
